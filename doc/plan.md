Re-understanding plan and build a plan system.

## background

### plan is important

Without plan, life can be really mess and complex. Without plan, we don't know what to do next, even hardly to know what we have done before.

### insist on making plan is difficult

- it's a daily job and honestly it's maybe boring.

Don't trust man's willpower, it's weak.

- sometimes plan may not work, we have to remember somethings in mind, that weaken our trust to plan.

If you can not make your plan alive to remind you, to do some handful job, it's better to not use the plan.

- plan can changed at any time.

It can be a heavy job, if your plan changes a lot.

- If a plan is just a recoder or just a list we should do, it's not that useful.

Make a list is a big progress, but not enough.

- There are so many types of plan, it can be a trouble.

Summary up, there are some main problems when we try to make plan in our life:

Objective

- cost of time

- difficult of thinking and management

- some functional edges

Subjective

- lazy
